You will need to give Vimac Accessibility permissions in Security & Privacy. When you update Vimac, even though the app is in the permissions list, you have to untick and tick it (or remove and add back) for permissions to be granted.

# How to use Vimac

The default shortcut for activating Vimac is CMD + Shift + Space

Here are the commands currently supported:

1. Single left-click on element ("ce")
2. Single right-click on element ("rce")
3. Double left-click on element ("dce")
4. Move to element ("me")
5. Scroll with HJKL keys ("s"). Your cursor has to hover over the scroll area.

Tips:

1. When the yellow hints are shown on-screen, you can use the Spacebar to rotate the height of the overlapping hints.

2. After executing a right-click command, use the arrow-keys + Enter to select one of the menu items.

3. Before entering scroll mode, use "me" to move your cursor over a scroll area.

# How do I report a bug / request a new feature?
